=Stuff to know=
  * Tested on Windows 7, Windows XP
  * Software uses PHP, Apache, PostgreSQL

=What you need=
  * WAMP
  * PostgreSQL

=How to install=
  # install the required software & moving the script
    # WAMP. The installation directory must be C:\wamp
    # PostgreSQL. Set the password to postgres. If asked, set the username to postgres as well
    # Move the folder 3tab_full to C:\wamp\www\
    # The settings of directories and passwords can be found in databases.yml and config.php under 3tab_full\3tab\config\
  # Fixing the corrupt dll files in WAMP
    # Exit WAMP
    # WAMP 2.0c uses php5.2.6. The dll files for pgsql in this version are broken
    # Go to C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.2.6\ext, and replace php_pdo_pgsql.dll and php_pgsql.dll with the files in the installation package (dll files)
    # Start WAMP, left click the system tray icon, click on start services. After that, left click again and go to PHP->PHP extensions. Make sure php_pgsql and php_pdo_pgsql have checkmarks next to them
    # Go to http://localhost/?phpinfo=1 and if you see pdo_pgsql and pgsql, you’ve done it correctly
  # Changing timeout settings for WAMP
    # As rounds progress, it will take a longer time to confirm the results after inputting all the data. The current WAMP settings set a timeout limit to 30 seconds, which needs to be changed to 0 (=unlimited)
    # Go to Wamp\bin\apache\apache2.2.8\bin\php.ini. Change the value of max_execution_time and max_input_time to 0 from 30 and 60 respectively.
    # Change settings for Wamp\bin\php\php5.2.6\php.ini as well. It is necessary to change both files.
    # Click on restart all services->start all services. Make sure the system tray icon turns white (from red, then yellow)
  # Setting up postgreSQL
    # Start->postgresql8.4->pgAdminIII
    # Connect to the server ‘postgreSQL 8.4’(password should be postgres), right click database, and create a new database. The database name must be called '3tab'
    # Right click database stab, select ‘create script’ (or execute arbitrary SQL queries)
    # Click file->open, select ‘lib.model.schema.sql’. Do the same for the 'views.sql' file. It can be found in the C:\WAMP\www\3tab_full\3tab\data\sql
    # Query-> execute pgScript (or press F6)
    # Repeat the two steps above for the 'views.sql' file. It can be also found at C:\WAMP\www\3tab_full\3tab\data\sql folder.
  # Access http://localhost/3tab_full/3tab/web/stab_dev.php/tournament . If the page is displayed, you’re done!
